# Atlas3Extras: Extending your Mendix styling

Atlas3Extras is an extension of the styling of standard Mendix v9+ elements, based on Atlas3. It gathers additional stylings for Mendix elements that we come accross during development and store them here for future use.

This module also shows how to store your own extensions for reuse across you app and other apps. See your app's projectdirectory, go to subdirectory Atlas3Extras and see the main.scss and the subdirectories per element.

## Demo
Demo of the elements are shown on:
- https://baseapplication-sandbox.mxapps.io via menu ‘UI helpers’
- https://service.mendixcloud.com via menu 'Atlas3 UI helpers

If you like this and want to share some of your own styling with us, contact us via the feedback-button of the base-application.

## Implementation

- Download this module from the appstore like you would with any other module.
- Add any of the Atlas3Extras-classes to the element that you want styled.

To see which classes are available per element, check your \themesource\atlas3extras\web\component\ where you will find a scss for each element. So far:
- datagrid.scss 
- datagrid2.scss 
- popup.scss
- radiobuttons.scss
- tooltip.scss
